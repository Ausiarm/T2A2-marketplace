# T2A2 Marketplace Project - FitFoundation


## Problem To Be Solved
- In the fitness sphere of the internet community there is a preponderance of services that guide new learners down paths that lead to bad habits, personal-image-shaming, and ultimately failure of the goal to make health and fitness a part of ones' life. This issue is compounded by investors pushing products through leaders of the community who are paid to support them without necessarily believing in them. These products, regardless of their efficacy, are seen by acolytes and initiates as panaceas to their personal problems. As more individuals seek to adopt healthy lifestyles this duplicity is leading to a lack of faith in the pursuit of health and causing newcomers to believe that vanity is more important than well-being. 
- To further elaborate on this problem it can be broken down into two constituent parts:
    1. Personal
        - Too often is it the case that beginners find themselves being incredibly critical of their own abilities as well as their image. It stands to reason that as a result, if someone wants to change their health, they must first be willing to adjust the system of judgement that they use to analyze their own life. 
    2. Extra-Personal
        - Beyond personal barriers, the second most significant threat to successfully bettering ones' health and well-being is interaction with others. Humans often rely on experts in fields that they have little-to-no practice in to guide them in a safe and sound direction. Unfortunately, this is not the case in the health and fitness industry. Often, professionals who have put in the time to gain status in the community use that status to sell products that had very little bearing on their own ability to attain a high health status. This misleading can very often cause beginners to give up, believing that they have some intrinsic flaw that is holding them back when they can't attain the "immediate" results that these industry professionals tout so highly. 
        - Comparison of phsyical form, also falling into the Extra-Personal category, can be very damaging to a beginner's mentality. Many professionals in industry fail to make it known that they have spent almost a lifetime attaining the form they have. This misleading must be addressed early on in the journey of a beginner or run the risk of tainting their understanding of how beautiful their own form is.

## Why Solve This Problem? 
- Overall health and well-being are critical to the maintainence of a thriving life in the developed communities around planet earth today. It is easy for an individual to overlook or not place emphasis on these two facets of life when they are obfuscated by the obligations that most working adults face. However, a moderate and healthy focus on these two aspects of being lead to healthier humans who both live longer and are more productive members of the societies within which they exist. It is critical that, in the wake of a rapid expansion thanks to sensationalism on the part of the internet and influencers, regular humans develop a healthy relationship with health. Teaching them to focus on what works for them and what makes them feel best regardless of the influence of dubious products and sellers who seek to confuse attainment of health with attainment of wealth for themselves at the cost of those who they train.
