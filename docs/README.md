# T2A2 Marketplace Project - FitFoundation


## Problem To Be Solved
- In the fitness sphere of the internet community there is a preponderance of services that guide new learners down paths that lead to bad habits, personal-image-shaming, and ultimately failure of the goal to make health and fitness a part of ones' life. This issue is compounded by investors pushing products through leaders of the community who are paid to support them without necessarily believing in them. These products, regardless of their efficacy, are seen by acolytes and initiates as panaceas to their personal problems. As more individuals seek to adopt healthy lifestyles this duplicity is leading to a lack of faith in the pursuit of health and causing newcomers to believe that vanity is more important than well-being. 
- To further elaborate on this Problem it can be broken down into two sections:
    1. Personal
    2. Extra-Personal

## Why Solve This Problem? 
- Overall health and well-being are critical to the maintainence of a thriving life in the developed communities around planet earth today. It is easy for an individual to overlook or not place emphasis on these two facets of life when they are obfuscated by the obligations that most working adults face. However, a moderate and healthy focus on these two aspects of being lead to healthier humans who both live longer and are more productive members of the societies within which they exist. It is critical that, in the wake of a rapid expansion thanks to sensationalism on the part of the internet and influencers, regular humans develop a healthy relationship with health. Teaching them to focus on what works for them and what makes them feel best regardless of the influence of dubious products and sellers who seek to confuse attainment of health with attainment of wealth for themselves at the cost of those who they train.
